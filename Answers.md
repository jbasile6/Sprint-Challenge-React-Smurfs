1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

Client-side routing is whe the routing is handled internally by the JavaScript that is already loaded onto the page. It uses the memory within the application to tell the browser what to display when a resource is requested.

Server-side routing has to reload the requested page (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc) to deliver the content to the user. One page gets loaded at a time rather than the entire app being loaded initially. The information is requested by user events.
